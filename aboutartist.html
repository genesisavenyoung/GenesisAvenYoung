    <h1>About the Artist</h1>
    <p>Genesis is an interdisciplinary artist whose current focus is on creating poetry, music, paintings, zines and books. Performance art is a crucial part of their practice - previously performing in drag as Qwerty Killz - they explore the impact of gender and trauma and mental illness in a whimsical manner. The body serves as the main medium of Genesis, and they enjoy living life as part of their art. Genesis finds ways to shape their narrative and create their own reality in spite of the dominant cultural stories around disability, queerness, and femininity.</p>
